## My Personal Business and Blog Site

I created this personal site as a place to, first, showcase some of my programming knowledge and learn about Next.js with App Router along with Tailwind, and secondly, as a place to hold my musings about software product development in blog form. Here I talk about my experiences working in software engineering, product development and program management.
My site has also since evolved as a home to showcase my fractional services through my buisness NC Consulting: I partner with growth-stage startups and mid-sized SaaS companies helping them ship faster, scale sustainably, and build products customers love all without burning out their teams.
