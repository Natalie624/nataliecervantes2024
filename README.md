## My Personal Portfolio and Blog Site

I created this personal website as a place to, first, showcase some of my programming knowledge and learn about Next.js with App Router along with Tailwind, and secondly, as a place to hold my musings in blog form about my experiences working in software engineering, product development and program management.
